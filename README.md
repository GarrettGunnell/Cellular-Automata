# Cellular Automata
by Garrett Gunnell

This project implements several compute shader kernels to execute and iterate new generations of several Cellular Automata. The implemented automatons are Rule 110, Brian's Brain, a Belousov-Zhabotinsky reaction model, and Seeds. This project is used for the demo in my youtube video on the same [subject](https://youtu.be/3NIMY01R-xM).
